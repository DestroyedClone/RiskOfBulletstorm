#[Equipment]

#[Curse]
[unimplemented] Picking up RiskOfBulletstorm items that defy Kaliber adds +0.25 curse. Each subsequent stack of a single item will add +0.1.
Curse increases the chance of an enemy becoming Jammed.

#[Elites]
Kaliber's Wrath - Jammed {0}
Jammed Elites deal 300% ([unimplemented]+20% per stage) damage. This damage scaling better reflects RoR2's health scaling vs Gungeon's.
