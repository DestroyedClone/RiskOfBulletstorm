It's got a green lens, and looks like a sniper scope.\n4:55 - [Kate] Seems to work whether it's attached or not, but I can't really look through it if it's not actually attached. Decision: attaching it.\n5:20 - [Kate] Not really sure it fits this place, since its just a scope. Then again, there was some duct tape in a chest, so maybe its not that weird...\n6:00 - [Kate] I'm requesting a possible analysis sometime, I don't think this is just a scope. I'm hitting a lot more of my shots. Maybe I'm just more focused.\n6:02 - [Kate] Scratch that, this is ACTUALLY reducing the spread of bullets. I'm kinda curious how it works, but I'll study it at the shop.\n3:00 - [Kate] I am now back in the Breach. The shopkeeper did not like me testing the scope.",

		"ITEM_BACKPACK_LORE": "While backpacks may seem to be useless once you use spatial compression technology, reports have come in demonstrating that a certain common backpack exceeds this. Most spatial compression technologies can only capture a specific form or type of item or structure. Sure, in this regard the structure capturing is superior, but its significantly different than the current features observed using backpacks. While not conclusive, reports have stated that some users have up to 2304 solid blocks of 1m cubed in volume. We've even heard reports that they've been able to store and deploy highly dense crystals that seem to explode when fractured. The current technologies can only compress about 25% of the reported backpack capacity, while keeping that capacity lowers the decompression quality down to a staggering 92%! Truly, we must strive to reach these heights. - Report by Minnie Raria, 2XXX",
